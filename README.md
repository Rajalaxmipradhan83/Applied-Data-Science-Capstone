SpaceX-Falcon9-First-Stage-Landing-Prediction

In this capstone project, our goal is to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX offers Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, while other providers charge upwards of $165 million. The significant cost savings come from SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. Accurately predicting the success of the first-stage landing can help estimate the overall launch cost.

This information is valuable for alternative companies looking to compete with SpaceX in the rocket launch market. In this lab, you will gather data from an API, ensuring it is properly formatted for analysis. Below is an example of a successful launch.
